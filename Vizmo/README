This is a very alpha version of Vizmo ...

A word of caution - no Error messages are displayed if something goes wrong, a 
trace may be found in the console window but no error recovery is in place.

So this version is only good for a correct sequence of actions, user inputs are 
checked but no action is taken if incorrect!! Behaviour is undefined from that 
point on.

         All suggestions and bug reports are most welcome

Required files:-
all tcl files:-
	TkInteractor.tcl
	vtkInt.tcl
	actrprop.tcl      
	genroad.tcl
	genpath.tcl  
	genquery.tcl
	VizmoView.tcl
the gif directory 
	gif/*.*
the startup script and main library 
	ev
	VizmoLib.so          
some data directory
	it's best to keep all your .g files in one place     

To execute: 
	type 'ev' at command line, this takes a few seconds to display
	the main window.

/---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

The main things you can do are 

1) load environments - specified as either .mod or .env files.
 ( if you are loading .mod files, the program assumes for now that the data
   files are in the same directory as the mod file )

2) create environments from scratch - ie. insert new actors as .g files.

3) currently you can only pick an actor through the Actor Properties dialog box - the
 selected item in the list is the selected actor for deletion. Selected actor's
 properties are visible on left panel.

4) save environments - choose a name other than the default.
this automatically creates a .mod and .init corresponding to the current environment.

5) modify a selected actor's properties - through the Actor Properties dialog.
right now transforming the actor updates its position but this is not reflected 
in the display.

6) generate queries - 
	this option is only valid if your environment has at 
	least 1 robot. If there are no robots, the lists will have no entries 
	but further operations in the dialog may bomb. JUST CLOSE IF EMPTY.

7) save a generated query and reload to edit queries.

8) View manipulation ->
	right mouse click 
	drag towards outside of window - zoom in
	drag towards center of window - zoom out

	left mouse click 
	rotate in direction of dragging eg left/right or any angle

	middle mouse click
	camera pan in direction of dragging

	view reset - an icon on the toolbar and a menu option, resets camera
	so all objects are visible

9) path display ->
	/-----------------------------------------------/
	   only VALID if an environment is loaded!!!!
	/-----------------------------------------------/

	( behaviour is undefined if this is violated !)
	load a path file for the current environment.
	this starts playing at once.
	
	buttons on animation control are

	stop - works!
	go to first frame - works! ( but doesn't display till you play again)
	play - works!
	step forward - works! ( you must stop the continuous play first )
	reverse play - X
	step backward - works! ( but doesn't display right till you move forward )
	go to end - works
