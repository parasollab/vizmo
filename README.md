# Vizmo

Visualization software for PMPL problems and results.

## Setup

This code requires a copy of PMPL's [old-trunk](https://github.tamu.edu/parasol/pmpl/tree/old-trunk) in the top-level directory to function. The PMPL copy must also have the required utilities (we are still working on a simple way to set this up).
