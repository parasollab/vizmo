To Create a Vizmo Release:

Setup:

1) Make sure ~/.rpmmacros is set correctly. Should look like:

%_topdir		/scratch/jdenny/rpmbuild
%dist .fc17.jdenny

2) Make sure you have the correct rpm build directories set up.
Mine look like:

Root is /scratch/jdenny/rpmbuild

then the next level has these folders in all capital letters:

BUILD  BUILDROOT  RPMS  SOURCES  SPECS  SRPMS

In RPMS and specify the architectures as folders:

i386  x86_64

Making a release:

1) Open VizmoRelease.sh and set the version number for the release.
2) Set the RPMBUILDDIR to be the root of the rpmbuild directory on your machine.
3) Type make to create the rpms, which will be located in
RPMBUILDDIR/RPMS/<arch> where <arch> is the architecture for the computer.
4) Get approval for a new release to be sent out.
5) Send the rpms to parasol-support@cse.tamu.edu requesting a new release to be
installed.
6) Email OBPRM@listserv.tamu.edu that a new vizmo release is out.
